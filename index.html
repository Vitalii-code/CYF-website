  <h1>Open-Source Software</h1>

<p> <b>O</b>pen-<b>S</b>ource <b>S</b>oftware or <b>OSS</b> for short is a type of software that allows the user to view, study and redistribute the code to other people. </p>

<div class="list">
  <ol>
    <h3>I like OSS for a few reasons: </h3>
    <li>It allows anyone to study and learn from the code.</li>
    <li>It allows you to contribute to the code if there is something you don't like about a program.</li>
    <li>Anyone can audit the program to know that it's safe and secure.</li>

  </ol>

    <h3>Some of the disadvantages include: </h3>
    <li>Sometimes projects "die" because the maintainer loses interest in supporting it(because it's ususally volunteer work).</li>
    <li>Sometimes there are limited features because again it's made by volunteers</li>
  </ol>

<h4> An example of a few OSS programs featuring <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-GB/">Firefox</a>(web browser), <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice </a>(office suite) , <a href="https://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>(multimedia player) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunar">Thunar</a>(a file manager) </h4>

<h3> A few more examples of OSS software:</h3>

<p>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Tux.svg" alt="Logo of the linux kernel" height="50px"> The biggest OSS project would probably be the linux kernel which contains about 40 millions lines of code! And is powering 90% of servers around the world.

<p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Firefox_logo%2C_2019.svg" alt="git logo" height="50px"> Firefox is also a big OSS project used by millions of people around the world. </p>
